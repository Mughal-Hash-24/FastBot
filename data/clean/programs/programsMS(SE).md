3. MS(SE) - Program Details

The MS Software Engineering curriculum has been designed to give the students a good understanding of best software engineering methodologies and practices, emerging technologies, and their application in various industries. The goal of the program is to teach students to become leaders in engineering high quality computing solutions to solve real life problems by conducting high quality applied research.

The following core courses are recommended to be completed before entering the MS (SE) program.

1. Computer Programming
2. Software Engineering
3. Software Quality Engineering
4. Data Structures
5. Object Oriented Analysis and Design
6. Human Computer Interaction

A student selected for admission having deficiency in the above stated courses may be required to study a maximum of FOUR courses. These courses must be passed in the first two semesters. Deficiency courses shall be determined by the Graduate Studies Committee, before admitting the student.No fee is charged for studying deficiency courses. A student cannot take MS courses unless all specified deficiency courses have been passed.

Typical course load in a semester is four courses. However, NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester. For successful completion of the MS SE degree, the student must undertake a 6 credit hour MS Project, spread over two regular semesters.

For the award of MS degree, a student must have:

- Passed courses totalling at least 30 credit hours, including all those courses which have been specified as Core courses
- Obtained a CGPA of at least 2.5
