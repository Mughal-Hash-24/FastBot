3. MS(Math) - Program Details

This program aims at training the candidates in a number of advance mathematical courses. Having done this they are motivated to undertake research in some area of pure and applied mathematics. The successful candidates are expected to serve the nation as academicians as well as researchers.

Typical course load in a semester is four courses. However, NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester.

A student has the option to persue MS either by undertaking a 6 credit hour MS thesis, or by taking a 3 credit hour Research Survey plus one taught course

For the award of MS degree, a student must have:

- Passed courses totalling at least 30 credit hours, including the four major courses
- Obtained a CGPA of at least 2.5
