3. MS(EE) - Program Details

The purpose of the MS program in Electrical Engineering is to attain theoretical and practical depth in one of the

    areas of interest.The MS(EE) program is structured in such a way as to enhance the student's critical thinking

    and intuitive abilities using a combination of highly specialized courses and expert supervision. The program

    aims to produce graduates who will have the abilities and skills to be employed as practicing engineers in fields

    such as design, research, development, testing, and manufacturing, as well as assuming positions of leadership

    and responsibility within organizations.

Three options:6-credit hour Thesis or 3 credit hour Project with one additional elective or MS by course work.

Typical course load in a semester is four courses. However, NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester.

For the award of MS degree, a student must have:

- Passed courses totalling at least 30 credit hours, including THREE Core courses
- Obtained a CGPA of at least 2.5
