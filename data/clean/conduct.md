University aims to equip students to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The University expects its students to strive towards acquisition of attributes that befit the national objectives. These attributes, in turn, should be reflected in their everyday behaviour, attitude and dress.

In order to achieve these goals all students are obliged to strictly follow the Code of Conduct laid down below:

That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do.’ ‘And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms."(Pickthal)
