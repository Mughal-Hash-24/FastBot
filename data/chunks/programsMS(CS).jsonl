MS(CS) - Program Details\n\nThe MS (Computer Science) comprises of both course work as well as research component. There are four \u2018core courses\u2019 aimed at strengthening the understanding and competence of students in computer science fundamentals. The University expects its MS graduates to pursue careers either as \u2018Computer Science Faculty Members\u2019 or as \u2018Software Development Managers\u2019 in the industry.\n\nThe following core courses are recommended to be completed before entering the MS (CS) program.\n\n1. Computer Programming\n2. Data Structures\n3. Operating Systems\n4. Database Systems\n5. Analysis of Algorithms\n6. Computer Networks\n7. Theory of Automata\n8. Software Engineering\n9. Assembly Lang. / Computer Arch.\n\nA student selected for admission having deficiency in the above stated courses may be required to study a maximum of FOUR courses. These courses must be passed in the first two semesters. The deficiency courses shall be determined by the Graduate Studies Committee before admitting the student.No fee will be charged for studying deficiency courses.A student selected for admission having deficiency in the above stated courses may be required to study a maximum of FOUR courses, which must be passed in the first two semesters. Deficiency courses shall be determined by the Graduate Studies Committee, before admitting the student. Fee is not charged for studying deficiency courses. A student cannot take MS courses unless all specified deficiency courses have been passed.\n\nNUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester. A student has the option to pursue MS by undertaking either a 6-credit hour MS Thesis or MS Project, spread over two regular semesters.\n\nFor the award of MS degree, a student must have:\n\n- Passed courses totaling at least 30 credit hours, including four core courses\n- Obtained a CGPA of 2.5 or more.\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 1 |\n| 1 | Applied Programming1 | NC |\n| 2 | Core Course-I | 3+0 |\n| 3 | Core Course-II | 3+0 |\n| 4 | Core Course-III | 3+0 |\n| Total | 9 + 0 |\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 2 |\n| 1 | Research Methodology | 3+0 |\n| 2 | Computing Elective-I | 3+0 |\n| 3 | Computing Elective-II | 3+0 |\n| Total | 9 + 0 |\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 3 |\n| 1 | Computing Elective-III | 3+0 |\n| 2 | MS Thesis-I/MS Project-I | 0+3 |\n| Total | 3 + 3 |\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 4 |\n| 1 | Computing Elective-IV | 3+0 |\n| 2 | MS Thesis-II/MS Project-II | 0+3 |\n| Total | 3 + 3 |\n\nNote\u00a01:Applied Programming course is of No Credit (NC), but it must be passed.Note\u00a02:Registration in \u201cMS Thesis - I\u201d is allowed provided the student has:Earned at least 15 creditsPassed the \u201cResearch Methodology\u201d courseCGPA is equal to or more than 2.5Core CoursesCS\u00a05005\u00a0\u00a0Advanced Analysis of AlgorithmsCS\u00a05006\u00a0\u00a0Theory of Programming LanguagesCS\u00a05007\u00a0\u00a0Advanced Theory of ComputationCS\u00a05009\u00a0\u00a0Advanced Operating Systems\n\nNote\u00a01:Applied Programming course is of No Credit (NC), but it must be passed.\n\nNote\u00a02:Registration in \u201cMS Thesis - I\u201d is allowed provided the student has:\n\n- Earned at least 15 credits\n- Passed the \u201cResearch Methodology\u201d course\n- CGPA is equal to or more than 2.5\n\n- CS\u00a05005\u00a0\u00a0Advanced Analysis of Algorithms\n- CS\u00a05006\u00a0\u00a0Theory of Programming Languages\n- CS\u00a05007\u00a0\u00a0Advanced Theory of Computation\n- CS\u00a05009\u00a0\u00a0Advanced Operating Systems\n\n1.
