The grade issued by the University will be final. Two types of averages will be computed for the grades obtained by each student, the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). SGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester.\n\nSGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester.\n\nCGPA is the weighted average of all the courses taken so far. For repeat courses, only the most recent grade points are used, even if they are less than the earlier attempts.\n\nThe following points need to be noted:\n\n- \"W\" will appear as a grade in the transcript like any other grade.\n- \"I\" will appear as a temporary grade in the transcript subject to change to the grade awarded. Grade \u201cI\u201d shall automatically convert to an \u201cF\u201d grade before the end of the next semester.\n\nRepeat courses will be indicated on the transcript together with the repeat count.\n\n\"S\" or \"U\" is awarded for PhD Thesis work only and is not considered in CGPA calculation.", "tokens": 232}, {"heading": "## Letter Code Interpretation", "content": "Letter grades for BBA & BS programs\n\n| Grade | Points | Interpretation |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| A+ | 4.00 | Excellent |\n| A | 4.00 | Excellent |\n| A- | 3.67 | Very Good |\n| B+ | 3.33 | Very Good |\n| B | 3.00 | Good |\n| B- | 2.67 | Average |\n| C+ | 2.33 | Below Average |\n| C | 2.00 | Adequate |\n| C- | 1.67 | Pass |\n| D+ | 1.33 | Pass |\n| D | 1.00 | Pass |\n\nLetter grades for MBA & MS programs\n\n| Grade | Points | Interpretation |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| A+ | 4.00 | Excellent |\n| A | 4.00 | Excellent |\n| A- | 3.67 | Very Good |\n| B+ | 3.33 | Good |\n| B | 3.00 | Average |\n| B- | 2.67 | Below Average |\n| C+ | 2.33 | Adequate |\n| C | 2.00 | Pass |\n\nLetter grades for PhD programs\n\n| Grade | Points | Interpretation |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| A+ | 4.00 | Excellent |\n| A | 4.00 | Excellent |\n| A- | 3.67 | Very Good |\n| B+ | 3.33 | Good |\n| B | 3.00 | Average |\n| B- | 2.67 | Below Average |\n\nThe Following grades are common for all degree programs:\n\n| Grade | Points | Interpretation |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| CR | - | Continuing Research |\n| F | 0.00 | Fail |\n| FA | 0.00 | Faill (Attendance Shortage) |\n| I | - | Incomplete |\n| W | - | Withdrawn |\n\nGrades CR, I and W are not used in computing SGPA or the CGPA.", "tokens": 318}, {"heading": "## Warning/Probation", "content": "1.
