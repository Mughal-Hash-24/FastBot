MS(SPM) - Program Details\n\nThis program enables students to develop skills necessary to manage software projects. In the final year, students take two-semester Project, which involves practical implementation of Project Management skills and techniques acquired through the program, as well as actual development of the project.\n\nThe MS (Software Project Management) program focuses on strengthening students\u2019 knowledge in theoretical as well as practical aspects of managing software projects. The program not only addresses management issues related to software industry but also covers the software engineering concepts, which must be known to a project manager.\n\nThe aim is to prepare middle and top management so that they meet the challenges of present and future needs of software industry. The coursework exposes the students to management and technical issues encountered in development of software solutions.\n\nTypical course load in a semester is four courses. However, NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester.\n\nFor the award of MS degree, a student must have:\n\n- Passed courses totalling at least 30 credit hours, including all those courses which have been specified as Core courses\n- Obtained a CGPA of at least 2.5\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 1 |\n| 1 | Research Methodology | 3+0 |\n| 2 | Software Project Management | 3+0 |\n| 3 | Management & Org.
