MS(EE) - Program Details\n\nThe purpose of the MS program in Electrical Engineering is to attain theoretical and practical depth in one of the\n\n    areas of interest.The MS(EE) program is structured in such a way as to enhance the student's critical thinking\n\n    and intuitive abilities using a combination of highly specialized courses and expert supervision. The program\n\n    aims to produce graduates who will have the abilities and skills to be employed as practicing engineers in fields\n\n    such as design, research, development, testing, and manufacturing, as well as assuming positions of leadership\n\n    and responsibility within organizations.\n\nThree options:6-credit hour Thesis or 3 credit hour Project with one additional elective or MS by course work.\n\nTypical course load in a semester is four courses. However, NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester.\n\nFor the award of MS degree, a student must have:\n\n- Passed courses totalling at least 30 credit hours, including THREE Core courses\n- Obtained a CGPA of at least 2.5\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 1 |\n| 1 | EExxxx Core Course-I | 3+0 |\n| 2 | EExxxx Core Course-II | 3+0 |\n| 3 | EE5011 Research Methodology | 3+0 |\n| Total | 9 + 0 |\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 2 |\n| 1 | EExxxx Core Course-III | 3+0 |\n| 2 | EExxxx Elective-I | 3+0 |\n| 3 | EExxxx Elective-II | 3+0 |\n| Total | 9 + 0 |\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 3 |\n| 1 | EExxxx Elective-III | 3+0 |\n| 2 | EE5091 MS Thesis-I/Elective-IV | 0+3 |\n| Total | 3 + 3 |\n\n| Sr. No | Course Name | Crdt Hrs. |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Semester 4 |\n| 1 | EExxxx Elective-V | 3+0 |\n| 2 | EE5092 MS Thesis-II/MS Project/Elective-VI | 0+3 |\n| Total | 3 + 3 |\n\nCore Courses for Electrical Engineering:(Any THREE of the following courses must be passed)\n\n- CS5012 Adv.
