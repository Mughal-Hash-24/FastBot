Accounting & Finance are the most significant and critical areas in the system of free enterprise. Good financial management is, therefore, vitally important to the economic health of business organizations. However, the constant shifts in economic conditions, intense competition for financial resources and questionable business practices have made financial management a complex and challenging undertaking. The BS Accounting & Finance program is designed to prepare students to meet the challenges posed by this complex but exciting area that has assumed much greater importance in the wake of the recent financial crisis in the world. This crisis has taught us that prudent financial management could mean the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful business enterprise. BS Accounting & Finance is tailored to first impart a broad-based education in the fundamentals of business and management and then develop the quantitative and analytical skills necessary to become prudent, astute and ethical financial managers.

There are a number of pathways to choose from including audit, taxation, budget analysis, financial accounting and management accounting.
