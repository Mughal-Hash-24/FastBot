Master of Science (Computer Science)



The MS (Computer Science) comprises of both course work as well as research component. There are four ‘core courses’ aimed at strengthening the understanding and competence of students in computer science fundamentals. The University expects its MS graduates to pursue careers either as ‘Computer Science Faculty Members’ or as ‘Software Development Managers’ in the industry.

The following core courses are recommended to be completed before entering the MS (CS) program.

A student selected for admission having deficiency in the above stated courses may be required to study a maximum of FOUR courses. These courses must be passed in the first two semesters. The deficiency courses shall be determined by the Graduate Studies Committee before admitting the student.No fee will be charged for studying deficiency courses.A student selected for admission having deficiency in the above stated courses may be required to study a maximum of FOUR courses, which must be passed in the first two semesters. Deficiency courses shall be determined by the Graduate Studies Committee, before admitting the student. Fee is not charged for studying deficiency courses. A student cannot take MS courses unless all specified deficiency courses have been passed.

NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester. A student has the option to pursue MS by undertaking either a 6-credit hour MS Thesis or MS Project, spread over two regular semesters.

For the award of MS degree, a student must have:

Note 1:Applied Programming course is of No Credit (NC), but it must be passed.Note 2:Registration in “MS Thesis - I” is allowed provided the student has:Earned at least 15 creditsPassed the “Research Methodology” courseCGPA is equal to or more than 2.5Core CoursesCS 5005  Advanced Analysis of AlgorithmsCS 5006  Theory of Programming LanguagesCS 5007  Advanced Theory of ComputationCS 5009  Advanced Operating Systems

Note 1:Applied Programming course is of No Credit (NC), but it must be passed.

Note 2:Registration in “MS Thesis - I” is allowed provided the student has:
