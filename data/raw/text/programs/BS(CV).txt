Bachelor of Science (Civil Engineering)



Those who have taken the HSSC or an equivalent examination and are awaiting result are also eligible to apply.The four-year undergraduate programs of full time study are divided into eight semesters.

The Civil Engineering degree is based on the HEC/PEC approved curriculum. In the first year, the students learn the fundamentals of Civil Engineering supported by essential mathematics and physics courses. These courses are followed by breadth courses which introduce students to different aspects of Civil Engineering. In the senior year students choose a specialization stream and study advanced courses.

In the highly competitive job market a graduate engineer is not only required to be knowledgeable in technical areas but is also expected to have excellent communication skills and an appreciation of cost effective engineering solutions. Students are offered courses in communication skills to prepare them for challenging environments. Courses like Professional Ethics contribute towards enhancing soft skills that help prepare a well-rounded personality.

This degree program opens careers in different areas of Civil engineering.
