Repeating a Course

Incomplete Course



The performance of students is assessed during the semester through mid term tests, assignments, quizzes, case studies or any other method considered appropriate by the course instructor and the University, This shall be communicated to the students at the start of a course. For almost all courses, the semester work will contribute 50% towards the final grade, while the final examination will contribute the remaining 50% of the total marks. A letter grade will be awarded to each student based on his/her overall academic performance in a course.

The Grade Point Average calculation ensures a continuous scale for the respective grades. The grade issued by the University will be final. Two types of averages will be computed for the grades obtained by each student, the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). SGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester.

SGPA is the weighted average of grade points earned in a semester. The weights are taken as the ratio of course credits to the total credits taken by the student in the semester.

CGPA is the weighted average of all the courses taken so far. For repeat courses, only the most recent grade points are used, even if they are less than the earlier attempts.

The following points need to be noted:

Repeat courses will be indicated on the transcript together with the repeat count.

"S" or "U" is awarded for PhD Thesis work only and is not considered in CGPA calculation.

Letter grades for BBA & BS programs

Letter grades for MBA & MS programs

Letter grades for PhD programs

The Following grades are common for all degree programs:

Grades CR, I and W are not used in computing SGPA or the CGPA.

The admission will be cancelledautomaticallyafter completion of maximum duration allowed to earn a degree.

A student can repeat a course if that course has not been passed or the student desires to improve his/her grade. A student must repeat all failed courses. Students under warning must repeat such passed courses, in which their GPA is less than the minimum CGPA required for their degree.

For example, MS students under warning (CGPA less than 2.50) must repeat courses in which their GPA is less than 2.50 (i.e. C or C- grade).

A student may request an extension in the final examination for genuine reasons subject to the following.
